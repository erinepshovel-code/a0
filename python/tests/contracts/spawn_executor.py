"""Contract tests for python.services.spawn_executor.

Each test is referenced from the CONTRACTS block in
python/services/spawn_executor.py. Run via:

    python -m python.tests.contract_runner

These tests touch the real database; they create uuid-prefixed rows
that they own end-to-end and clean up in finally blocks. No mocking
of the executor itself — _claim_one_pending and _execute_one are
called directly so the tests exercise the same code paths the poller
loop runs in production.
