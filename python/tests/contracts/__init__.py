"""Contract test harness — see .local/skills/test-build/SKILL.md.

Provides a shared httpx AsyncClient configured against the running
FastAPI app (localhost:8001) with the live INTERNAL_API_SECRET attached.
Tests should use `client()` as an async context manager and `new_uid()`
for isolation.

The internal token is read at runtime from the uvicorn worker's environ
via /proc — same trick `start-dev.sh` uses to share the ephemeral dev
secret with curl smoke tests. This avoids requiring the runner to be
launched with a pre-shared token.
