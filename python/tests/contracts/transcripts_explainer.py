"""Contract tests for python.services.edcmbone_explainer.

Each test is referenced from the CONTRACTS block at the bottom of
python/services/edcmbone_explainer.py. Run via:

    python -m python.tests.contract_runner

These tests touch the real database; every test scope-isolates by
generating a unique user_id so they cannot collide with each other or
with real production users. No HTTP, no Stripe — they exercise the
storage primitives that back the explainer's pricing semantics.
