"""spawn_executor — execute the rows that sub_agent_spawn writes.

Closes the gap between `sub_agent_spawn` (which inserts an agent_runs
row but calls no model) and the inference layer (which has no awareness
of pending rows). The poller claims rows atomically, binds run-scoped
ContextVars, constructs an AgentInstance against the row's declared
provider, runs one inference turn with the row's task_summary as the
user message, and writes the result back via run_logger.emit so it
flows into the existing agent_logs stream and the merge tool's
JSONL artifact archival pipeline.

State machine (only state field on agent_runs is touched here):

    running   — written by sub_agent_spawn, awaiting executor
    executing — claimed by executor, inference in progress
    completed — inference finished, result + usage logged
    failed    — inference raised; error logged on the row
    merged    — sub_agent_merge called by parent (terminal — owned by merge)

Concurrency: rows are claimed via UPDATE … WHERE id IN (SELECT … FOR
UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1) RETURNING. Same shape as the stripe webhook
idempotency claim — a row can only be claimed once even across restarts
or competing poller instances.

Honest single-concern:
  * This module ONLY executes pending spawn rows. Orchestration modes
    (fan_out, council, daisy_chain, etc.) get a NotImplementedError
    until their own modules land — no silent fallback to single-mode.
  * Provider resolution honors the row's `providers` list. "active"
    resolves to energy_registry.get_active_provider(). Anything else is
    used as the model_id directly (resolve_model_id handles legacy
    provider-id matching). Failure to resolve raises and the row is
    marked failed — not silently rerouted.

# id: spawn_executor_marks_failed_on_exception
#   given: a claimed row whose providers list resolves to an unknown id
