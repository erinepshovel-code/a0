"""Tier system — volatile vs. committed continuity.

Tier 1 (Volatile): Core ↔ Phonon
- transient, scratch, cycle-local, non-authoritative
- requires no Jury mediation
- may NOT silently become Tier 2
- does not carry persistence authority

Tier 2 (Commit): Core → Jury → Memory
- continuity-bearing, persistent, identity-relevant, explicitly committed
- requires Jury mediation
- may not be unilaterally performed by a core
- may not arise from silent promotion of Tier 1

Law 3: Volatile state is not committed continuity.
Law 4: Persistence requires adjudication.
