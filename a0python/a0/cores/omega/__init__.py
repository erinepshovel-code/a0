"""Omega — private synthesis and integration cognitive core.

Omega thinks. Omega does not emit outward directly.

Omega's domain of concern: synthesis, integration, coherence —
combining Phi and Psi outputs into unified internal state for Meta-13.

Omega tensors hold:
- the interdependent way: the architectural framework, design philosophy,
  relational model, and core laws that govern the whole system
- supporting material: specs, glossary, principles, examples
