"""PTCA subagent definitions for the claude-agent-sdk.

Each AgentDefinition maps to a PTCA architectural role.

Law 1: Private process is not public output.
Law 8: Capability does not equal authority.
Law 9: Guardian alone owns human-readable outward emission.
Law 13: Meta-13 chooses; advisory layers may influence salience but do not decide.
