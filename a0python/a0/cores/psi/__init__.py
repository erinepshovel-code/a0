"""Psi — private semantic and contextual cognitive core.

Psi thinks. Psi does not emit outward directly.

Psi's domain of concern: semantic processing, contextual reasoning,
relational inference — and the build logic of a0 (the routing/processing
framework that IS semantic work).

Psi tensors hold the a0 build logic.
